Baby TUX
========

This 'game' was created as a baby solution similar to babysmash_ and
alphababy_, with the aim of keeping small chidlren occupied at the computer,
while simultaneously preventing them from doing damage.

One of the main features of this game is that it is *hard to exit*; you must
type 'smash' and then press exit, all consecutively. The purpose of this is to
prevent babies from accidentally exiting and destroying your computer.

Animations appear when moving the mouse, clicking, or typing.
