Baby TUX
========

This 'game' was created as a baby solution similar to babysmash_ and
alphababy_, with the aim of keeping small children occupied at the computer,
while simultaneously preventing them from doing damage.

One of the main features of this game is that it is *hard to exit*; you must
type 'smash' and then press <escape>, all consecutively. The purpose of this is to
prevent babies from accidentally exiting and destroying your computer.

Animations appear when moving the mouse, clicking, or typing.

Dependencies
------------

Baby TUX requires:

* Python (tested on 2.7.2)

* Pyglet_ (a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python)

* Rabbyt_ (a fast 2D sprite engine using OpenGL)


If you are running this on a Debian based Linux disto, you will need to install: python-dev, mesa-common-dev, and libglu1-mesa-dev

Running app
-----------
To run the app, enter: *python game.py*
